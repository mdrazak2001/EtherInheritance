# EtherInheritance
EtherInheritance is a smart contract designed to facilitate the transfer of Ethereum (ETH) from parents to their children, ensuring that the children can only withdraw the funds once they reach a certain age. 
This smart contract provides a secure and automated way to manage inheritance, ensuring that the designated beneficiaries receive their funds at the appropriate time without the need for intermediaries.
The EtherInheritance contract is built on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging its security and transparency features to create a reliable inheritance system.
